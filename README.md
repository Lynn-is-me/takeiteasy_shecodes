# takeiteasy_shecodes

# Introduction
This project is made by our team #takeiteasy in Shecodes Hackathon 2023.

Because of many reasons, we do not have BackEnd Developer in our team, therefore this "final product" does not have BackEnd, which is indeed weird. However, we proud of this two-days-creation.

# Implementation

Please, run the `home\home.html` file for the best experience.

# Idea 

Our website is based on the main fuction of StackOverFlow and Pinterest. We want to create a community for desigers and editors from all over the world.

The main purpose of this web is the Forum, where users can ask and answer questions other users'questions about some of their fields's problems they are facing to. Consequently, clients of our website (designers, editors or just simply- those who likes pictures and editing!) can easily get help!

Moreover, we also add some interesting functions to our website. For instance, the Discovery, where users can share their favorite products, how they edit that pic, how they edit that video, that sound-effects... and other people can freely comment and upvote the post, which the owner of the post can gain Reputation.

Reputation can help our users a lot. If a user has some specific Reputation, they will allowed to sell their products on Discovery. In contrast, if users have some negative impact on our web (spam, advertising for example), their reputation will be decreased. Anh when the Reputation is lower than a threshold, their account will be banned from our server.
